\textit{This report consists in the representation and documentation of the coursework of the Professional Internship, carried out as a part of the Bachelor Degree in Computer Science at the School of Technology and Management of the Institute of Technology of Beja.}

\textit{The Internship was carried out at Optiply, in Ã‰vora, in the year of 2020/2021, with the aim of improving the integration and consolidation of the acquired knowledge, in the context of practice, the theoretical knowledge acquired throughout the Degree.}

\textit{The primordial objective of the internship was to improve the integration in the world of work. The idea of being interned at Optiply came from the idea of improving the student's first contact with the area of development in Backend, and the possibility of developing personally in an environment of work that is compatible with what is intended to do.}

\textit{The activities were developed taking into account the objectives initially outlined and that were: initial training via Udemy courses, the development of a project, planning and implementation of it.}

\textit{This project was a development of a Backend, which was developed in Java, using the framework Micronaut, linked to a Postgres database, and was developed in a local development environment using Docker containers.}

\textit{The learning was effective and perceptible, in the measure in which the activities were developed that provided the acquisition and the development of different technical and organizational competences.}

\textbf{Keywords}: \textit{Internship, Professional, Postgres, Backend, Development, Docker, Java, Micronaut}.
